# azure-ai-900
Azure machine learning &amp; AI- related projects for the bootcamp Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals. In this repo you will find a project done as part of the bootcamp which have the purpose of practicing the conceps learned.

The following is a description of the project: Its goal, step by step, results and conclusion.

----------------------

**1. What will be done**

Use of the Azure Vision Studio to analyze and generate insights for image files, creating captions, recognizing faces, extracting text from an image.

**2. What you will find in this repo**

- Input folder containing the images used in this project
- Output folder with the .json files obtained after processing these images

**3. Insights, thoughts & conclusion**

- In 1, 2, and 3, the image captioning service is able to recognize various elements from each picture, being able to caption everything with almost 100% accuracy. The only error was in 1, where it incorrectly labeled the man in the top left as wearing a mask.
- The picture in 4 is a Wendy's poutine advertisement, which is a picture I chose because, years ago, I was looking for a software capable of extracting the text from this image, so it is only fitting that I use it here. The Visual Studio OCR service accurately recognizes & extracts the text.
- In 5 we have a picture of our dear Phil Spencer, Microsoft Gaming's CEO. Visual Studio recognizes his face accurately.
